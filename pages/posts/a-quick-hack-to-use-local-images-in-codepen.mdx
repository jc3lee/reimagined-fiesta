Handling files is a pro feature in **Codepen**. Free users can't add local files like images to use them in the editor.

In this quick **3 steps tutorial**, we'll learn to host an image on **Github Pages** and use it in Codepen.

## Step 1: Upload an image to a new repository.


![creating a github repository](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/0.jpg)

 - Click on the \+ button (top right) then *New repository*

![choosing a github repository name](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/1.jpg)

- Add a repository name (I've called it *hosted-assets*). Then leave the other options to default and click on *Create repository.*

![ click on upload an image](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/2.jpg)

* Click on *uploading an existing file.*

![ upload an image](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/3.jpg)

* Either drag files from your PC or click on *choose your files* to upload. Then click on *Commit changes*.

## Step 2: Host your repository with Github Pages.

![ go to settings](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/4.jpg)

As you can see, *pink-kitty.jpg* has been added to the github repository.

* Click on Settings.

![update github pages source](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/5.jpg)

* Scroll to Github Pages and change the source from none to main branch then click on the *Save* button.

![get the link to github pages](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/6.jpg)

The page will reload, and on scrolling back to the Github Pages section, you'll find the newly created link.

* Click on the link to go to your Github Pages.

![404 page](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/7.jpg)

The page returns 404 not found because we haven't set a home page.

![add filename to path](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/8.jpg)

* Add your file name at the end of that url. In this case *pink-kitty.jpg*

And your image should pop up.

## Step 3: Use the uploaded image in codepen.

* Copy the previous link and replace the local image src in your codepen. For example replace:

`<img src="./pink-kitty.jpg" alt="pink kitty">`

with:

`<img src="https://ljc-dev.github.io/hosted-assets/pink-kitty.jpg" alt="pink kitty">`

### And tada üéâ!!!

## Tips:

* Be careful to use the Github Pages link and not the Github repository link.

* The next time you upload an image, you can click on *Add files* in the home of your repository and *Upload files.*

* There should now be an *Environment* section in the home of the repository with *github pages*. Click on it to view deployments and your live site.

* To add a folder, either drag the folder into the upload window if you are on a PC or follow [this stackoverflow solution to adding folders.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository)

### Update:

**@Pav1an** on Twitter has suggested a quick hack to make github host images üî• (doesn't work for other file types).

![Github issue hack ](/images/blog/a-quick-hack-to-use-local-images-in-codepen/10.jpg)

* Go to the homepage of one of your repositories or create one. 

* Click on the *Issues* tab and *Create an issue*.

* Instead of writing an issue report, drag an image to the issue box. Github will save the image as a png file and show a link like this:

`![pink-kitty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62596124/104592898-39710980-566f-11eb-8613-44762bcc233f.jpg)`

* Copy the link and use it as the src for your image in Codepen.
