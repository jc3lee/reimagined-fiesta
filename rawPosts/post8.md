Transitions are used for less complicated animations, to move from one stage to another. Animations with keyframes are more suited for complex animations."

So you want to animate with CSS? Great, let's get started üòÑ!

Most properties can be animated: `width`, `color`, `opacity`, `transform`, etc. In this tutorial, we are going to focus on `transform`.

With CSS `transform` we can rotate, scale, skew, or translate an html element.

Try hovering ( or clicking if you are on mobile) on the ninja images:

![no animation](https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/pen/BaQYmNY?editors=0100)

No animations yet. Here's the code:

```html
<img class="ninja1" src="https://ljc-dev.github.io/fluffy-octo-adventure/nin.png">
<img class="ninja2" src="https://ljc-dev.github.io/fluffy-octo-adventure/nin.png">
<img class="ninja3" src="https://ljc-dev.github.io/fluffy-octo-adventure/nin.png">
```

```css
img {
  display: block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: contain;
}

.ninja1:hover {
  transform: translateY(50px);
}

.ninja2:hover {
  transform: scale(1.5);
}

.ninja3:hover {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

On hover:

- `translateY(50px)` moves *ninja1* 50px down.

- `scale(1.5)` makes *ninja2* 1.5 times bigger.

- `rotate(45deg)` rotates *ninja3* 45deg clockwise.

### Transitions

Now let's see how we can animate those transformations with *CSS transitions*.

A transition animates the changes of one or multiple properties.

We add a 2s transition on `transform` with the following:

```css
.ninja1, .ninja2, .ninja3 {
  transition-property: transform;
  transition-duration: 2s;
}
```

* `transition-property` takes the name of the property to add a transition to. We can add multiple properties with the keyword `all` or separating each property with commas like `transition-property: transform, opacity`

* `transition-duration` sets the duration of the transition.

We can also use the shorthand `transition`:

```css
.ninja1, .ninja2, .ninja3 {
  transition: transform 2s;
}
```

This code and the one above are the same. 

We get an animation on hover:

![transition animation](https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/pen/JjbpOYG?editors=0100)

We can change the feel of the transition with `transition-timing-function`.

![timing function](/images/blog/introduction-to-css-animations/3.gif)

Defaults to `ease`. Let's try `ease-in-out`.

And finally add a 1s delay with `transition-delay`.

```css
.ninja1, .ninja2, .ninja3 {
  transition-property: transform;
  transition-duration: 2s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  transition-delay: 1s;
}
```

Or

```css
.ninja1, .ninja2, .ninja3 {
  transition: transform 2s ease-in-out 1s;
}
```

If you hover again on the ninja images, you'll notice the animations start with 1s delay.

### @keyframes animations

Another way to animate in CSS is with `animation` and `@keyframes` rules.

`@keyframes` rules define steps in an animation:

```css
@keyframes moveDown {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(50px);
  }
}
```

Some like to replace 0% and 100% with their keywords equivalent `from` and `to`.

You can add as many keyframes as you want from 0 to 100% and animate as many properties as you want.

This weird animation would totally work üëç.

```CSS
@keyframes weirdAnim {
  0% { transform: translateY(0); }
  11% { 
    width: 50px;
    background-color: green; 
    transform: rotate(90deg);
  }
  50% { height: 100px;}
  66% { transform: rotate(-720deg); }
  99% { 
    border-radius: 200px;
    background-color: black;
  }
  100% { 
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

To run it we need to refer to its name with `animation-name`:

```css
.ninja1{
  animation-name: weirdAnim;
}
```

And give it a duration with `animation-duration`:

```css
.ninja1{
  animation-name: weirdAnim;
  animation-duration: 5s;
}
```

With the `animation` shorthand:

```css
.ninja1{
  animation: weirdAnim 5s;
}
```

And we get this monstrosity:

![codepen](https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/pen/NWbyvaq)
(click on rerun to play the animation again)

Same with transitions we can change the feel of the animation with an
`animation-timing-function`. And add a delay with `animation-delay`.

```css
.ninja1{
  animation-name: weirdAnim;
  animation-duration: 5s;
  animation-timing-function: ease;
  animation-delay: 1s;
}
```

Or:

```css
.ninja1{
  animation: weirdAnim 5s ease 1s;
}
```

With keyframes animation, we can also decide how many times to run an animation with `animation-iteration-count`. Defaults to `1`. Setting it to `infinite` makes it run indefinitely.

I've used `infinite` for the cover animation. Here is the code for my text animation:

![text anim](https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/pen/WNoMdzr)

There are two more advanced animation properties:

* `animation-direction`:
  * `normal` (default) starts from the 1st keyframe.
  * `reverse` starts from the last keyframe.
  * `alternate` starts from the 1st to last but if the animation is repeated the next animation will go from last to first.
  * `alternate-reverse` is the same as alternate except it starts from the last keyframe.
([example](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_animation-direction))

* `animation-fill-mode`. It's set to `forwards` when we want to keep the animation state after it finished playing.

We are going to slide down the kpop girl image three times and hold the final position with `forwards`.

```html
<img class="kpop" src="https://ljc-dev.github.io/fluffy-octo-adventure/kpop.png">
```

```css
img {
  display: block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: contain;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(75%);
  }
}

.kpop{
  animation-name: slideDown;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-iteration-count: 3;
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}
```

Or:

```css
.kpop{
  animation: slideDown 3s 3 alternate forwards;
}
```

![kpop anim](https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/pen/eYBVLZB?editors=1000)

Notice how `alternate` is used to change the direction of the 2nd iteration. So instead of jumping back up and sliding down again, the animation runs in reverse and slides up.

And that's the end of this intro to transitions and keyframes animations.

One thing to be careful with shorthands is not to mix the properties order. You can omit the properties you won't change but don't put duration before the animation name for example.

Here's the correct properties order for transitions and animations:

`transition: property duration timing-function delay;`

`animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;`

### Thanks for reading!!

I hope you've got a better idea on how to animate with CSS now.

I've posted below a small series of common CSS animations - some with js. If you have any questions, leave a comment or hit me up on socials üëå.
